# AI-chatbot-for-Norwegian

In this big-size master-level project we are going to build an AI chatbots for Norwegian language. The
main goal of this chatbot is to answer on general questions of who are learning Norwegian
as a second language. It is meant to help them make some natural conversations.
But as the data grows and varies, we can use this chatbot for other purposes like for
industrial uses. To build this chatbot, we are going to use a neural network together with
some Information Retrieval techniques and NLP tools. More specifically we will create a
neural network which can classify the user input and return a response back to the user.
As a part of the preparing of the data, we will use NLP-tools like lemmatizing. At the end
of the preprocessing stage, we are going to use two approaches to numerically represent
our data. The first one is Bag of Words, an IR technique, while the second one is called
tf-idf, term frequency-inverse document frequency, an NLP-algorithm. We will also do
some adjustment on the user input, when necessary, to optimize the model where we will
make a spell checker from scratch. This spell checker is capable to detect the misspelled
Norwegian words and suggest words to substitute them. This can give better perdition of
the classes. Consequently, it returns qualitive responses to the user.
